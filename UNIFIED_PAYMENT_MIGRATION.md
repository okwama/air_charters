# Unified Payment System Migration Guide

## Overview

The Flutter app has been updated to use the new unified payment system that provides:
- **Automatic company routing** based on deal configurations
- **Split payments** (platform fee + company amount)
- **Transaction ledger** for full audit trail
- **Automatic provider selection** (Stripe Connect or M-Pesa Merchant)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Payment Models (`lib/core/models/payment_models.dart`)

Added new models to support the unified payment system:

```dart
// Unified payment request/response
class UnifiedPaymentRequest
class UnifiedPaymentResponse

// Transaction ledger for audit trail
class TransactionLedgerEntry

// Company payment account management
class CompanyPaymentAccount
class PaymentProviderInfo
```

### 2. Updated Booking Service (`lib/core/services/booking_service.dart`)

**New Methods:**
- `processUnifiedPayment()` - Main unified payment processing
- `getTransactionDetails()` - Get transaction details from ledger
- `getCompanyTransactions()` - Get company-specific transactions
- `getAvailablePaymentProviders()` - Get available payment providers
- `getCompanyPaymentAccounts()` - Get company payment accounts

**Legacy Methods (Deprecated):**
- `processPayment()` - Still available for backward compatibility

### 3. Updated Booking Provider (`lib/core/providers/booking_provider.dart`)

**New Methods:**
- `processUnifiedPayment()` - Unified payment processing with state management
- `getTransactionDetails()` - Transaction details with loading states
- `getCompanyTransactions()` - Company transactions with error handling
- `getAvailablePaymentProviders()` - Payment provider information
- `getCompanyPaymentAccounts()` - Company account management

### 4. Updated Payment Controller (`lib/core/controllers/payment.controller/payment_controller.dart`)

**New Methods:**
- `processUnifiedPayment()` - Main payment processing with validation
- `UnifiedPaymentResult` - New result class with detailed payment information

**Legacy Methods (Deprecated):**
- `processBookingPayment()` - Still available for backward compatibility

### 5. Updated Payment Screen (`lib/features/booking/payment/payment_screen.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Replaced `completePayment()` with `processUnifiedPayment()`
- Added detailed logging for unified payment results
- Enhanced error handling with unified payment responses

## API Endpoints

### New Unified Payment Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/unified-payments/process` | POST | Process payment with automatic routing |
| `/api/unified-payments/transaction/{id}` | GET | Get transaction details |
| `/api/unified-payments/company/{id}/transactions` | GET | Get company transactions |
| `/api/unified-payments/providers` | GET | Get available providers |
| `/api/unified-payments/company-accounts` | GET | Get company accounts |

|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/bookings/{id}/process-payment` | POST | Legacy payment processing |
| `/api/payments/create-intent` | POST | Create payment intent |
| `/api/payments/confirm` | POST | Confirm payment |

## Usage Examples

### 1. Process Unified Payment

```dart
final bookingProvider = context.read<BookingProvider>();

// Process payment using unified system
final result = await bookingProvider.processUnifiedPayment(
  bookingId: 'booking_123',
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_1234567890',
  paymentMethodId: 'pm_1234567890',
);

if (result != null) {
  print('Payment successful!');
  print('Transaction ID: ${result.transactionId}');
  print('Provider: ${result.paymentProvider}');
  print('Company: ${result.companyName}');
  print('Total: ${result.totalAmount}');
  print('Platform Fee: ${result.platformFee}');
  print('Company Amount: ${result.companyAmount}');
} else {
  print('Payment failed: ${bookingProvider.errorMessage}');
}
```

### 2. Get Transaction Details

```dart
final result = await bookingProvider.getTransactionDetails('txn_1234567890');

if (result != null) {
  print('Transaction: ${result.transactionId}');
  print('Status: ${result.status}');
  print('Ledger Entries: ${result.ledgerEntries.length}');
}
```

### 3. Get Company Transactions

```dart
final transactions = await bookingProvider.getCompanyTransactions('company_123');

for (final transaction in transactions) {
  print('Transaction: ${transaction.transactionId}');
  print('Amount: ${transaction.amount}');
  print('Type: ${transaction.transactionType}');
  print('Status: ${transaction.status}');
}
```

### 4. Get Available Providers

```dart
final providers = await bookingProvider.getAvailablePaymentProviders();

for (final provider in providers) {
  print('Provider: ${provider.name}');
  print('Type: ${provider.type}');
  print('Available: ${provider.isAvailable}');
}
```

## Payment Flow

### New Unified Payment Flow

1. **Create Booking with Payment Intent**
   ```dart
   final bookingWithIntent = await bookingProvider.createBookingWithPaymentIntent(booking);
   ```

2. **Process Payment (Unified System)**
   ```dart
   final result = await bookingProvider.processUnifiedPayment(
     bookingId: booking.id!,
     paymentIntentId: paymentIntent.id,
   );
   ```

3. **Automatic Processing**
   - System determines company from booking
   - Selects appropriate payment provider (Stripe Connect/M-Pesa Merchant)
   - Calculates platform fee and company amount
   - Creates transaction ledger entries
   - Routes payment to company account

### Legacy Payment Flow (Deprecated)

1. **Create Payment Intent**
   ```dart
   final paymentIntent = await bookingProvider.createPaymentIntent(...);
   ```

2. **Process Payment (Legacy)**
   ```dart
   final success = await bookingProvider.processPayment(
     bookingId: booking.id!,
     transactionId: transactionId,
     paymentMethod: 'card',
   );
   ```

  dealId: 1,
  totalPrice: 1000.0,
  // ... other fields
);

// Test payment intent
final testPaymentIntent = PaymentIntentModel(
  id: 'pi_test_123',
  clientSecret: 'pi_test_123_secret_456',
  amount: 1000.0,
  currency: 'USD',
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to process unified payment"**

   - Check company payment account is active

3. **"Payment provider not available"**
   - Check available payment providers
   - Verify company payment account configuration
   - Check provider-specific error messages
