fect! Now I understand the complete booking flow. Let me explain it step by step like you're 10 years old:

# 🛩️ Air Charters Booking Flow - Explained Simply!

## 📱 **Step 1: User Finds a Charter Deal**
- User opens the app and sees a list of available charter flights
- They pick one they like (like choosing a movie from Netflix!)
- The deal shows: departure city, destination city, date, time, aircraft type, and price

## 🎯 **Step 2: User Clicks "Book Now"**
- User taps the "Book Now" button on the charter deal
- This takes them to the **Booking Detail Page** (`booking_detail.dart`)
- Here they can see:
  - Pictures of the aircraft
  - Flight details (departure, destination, time)
  - Price information
  - Available seats

## ✅ **Step 3: User Confirms the Booking**
- User clicks "Continue" to go to **Confirm Booking Page** (`confirm_booking.dart`)
- This page shows:
  - Aircraft photos in a slideshow
  - Amenities (WiFi, food, etc.)
  - Flight details again
  - Price breakdown

## 👥 **Step 4: User Adds Passengers**
- User goes to **Review Trip Page** (`review_trip.dart`)
- Here they can:
  - Add passenger information (names, passport numbers)
  - Choose extra services (food onboard, ground transportation)
  - Pick billing region
  - Agree to terms and conditions

## 💳 **Step 5: Payment Process**
- User clicks "Proceed to Payment"
- This creates a booking in the system (but not confirmed yet)
- User goes to **Payment Screen** (`payment_screen.dart`)
- They enter their credit card details
- Stripe processes the payment securely

## 🎉 **Step 6: Booking Confirmation**
- If payment is successful, user sees **Booking Confirmation Page** (`booking_confirmation_page.dart`)
- This shows:
  - ✅ Success message
  - 📋 Flight ticket details
  - 👥 Passenger information
  - �� Payment status
  - 📱 Next steps (like when to arrive at airport)

## 🔄 **What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

### **Frontend (Flutter App):**
1. **BookingProvider** manages the booking state
2. **BookingController** coordinates between different parts
3. **PassengerProvider** handles passenger information
4. **AuthProvider** makes sure user is logged in

### **Backend (NestJS Server):**
1. **BookingsService** creates the booking in database
2. **PaymentService** handles Stripe payment processing
3. **PassengerService** saves passenger information
4. **EmailService** sends confirmation emails

## 🛠️ **What You Can Change:**

### **Easy Changes:**
- **Colors and styling** in the UI files
- **Text and messages** shown to users
- **Images and icons** used in the app

### **Medium Changes:**
