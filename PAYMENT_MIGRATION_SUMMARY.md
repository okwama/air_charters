## Usage Example

```dart
// New unified payment flow
final result = await bookingProvider.processUnifiedPayment(
  bookingId: 'booking_123',
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_1234567890',
  paymentMethodId: 'pm_1234567890',
);

if (result != null) {
  print('Payment successful!');
  print('Transaction ID: ${result.transactionId}');
  print('Provider: ${result.paymentProvider}');
  print('Company: ${result.companyName}');
  print('Total: ${result.totalAmount}');
  print('Platform Fee: ${result.platformFee}');
  print('Company Amount: ${result.companyAmount}');
  print('Ledger Entries: ${result.ledgerEntries.length}');
}
```

## Verification

To verify the migration is working correctly:

1. **Test Unified Payment Flow**
   ```dart
   // Create booking and process payment
   final bookingWithIntent = await bookingProvider.createBookingWithPaymentIntent(booking);
   final result = await bookingProvider.processUnifiedPayment(
     bookingId: bookingWithIntent.booking.id!,
     paymentIntentId: bookingWithIntent.paymentIntent.id,
   );
   ```

2. **Check Transaction Details**
   ```dart
   final transaction = await bookingProvider.getTransactionDetails(result.transactionId);
   print('Transaction: ${transaction?.transactionId}');
   print('Ledger Entries: ${transaction?.ledgerEntries.length}');
   ```

3. **Verify Company Routing**
   ```dart
   print('Company: ${result.companyName}');
   print('Provider: ${result.paymentProvider}');
   print('Company Amount: ${result.companyAmount}');
   ```

## Conclusion
